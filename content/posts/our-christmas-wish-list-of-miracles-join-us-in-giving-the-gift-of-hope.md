  ### **Our family’s little ministry has seen God turn small offerings into great miracles and this Christmas, we invite you to be part of the story.**

  For over five years, GIA’s Hope has been planting seeds of hope ...helping orphans come home and bringing comfort to the brokenhearted.

  Our mission flows straight from Isaiah 61, to “_bind up the brokenhearted, proclaim freedom for the captives, and comfort those who mourn.”_

  Through every project, prayer, and partnership, our desire is to be missionaries to the brokenhearted — to carry the love of Jesus, Emmanuel - God with us, into places of pain and loss.

  Gianna’s life taught us what it means to fight for hope and to run toward the brokenhearted, not away from them.

  Her legacy continues to bloom through every story, every outreach, and every act of love that declares: God’s love still changes lives.

  What began as a small seed has grown beyond what we could have imagined. Our tiny but mighty little ministry has reached across the world to plant seeds of hope.

  Though we are a humble, family-run organization, God continues to show that He delights in using small things to make a big impact.

  It’s been all Him .... not us. We’ve simply offered our “fish and loaves” and watched Him multiply them through the beautiful body of Christ.

  What an honor it has been to witness our daughter’s life unfolding into more miracles than we could ever count.

  This Christmas, we invite you to partner with us to be a vehicle of hope, helping us plant a garden of love that will blossom into a harvest of healing for many who are hurting around the world.
