  GIA’S Hope is a 501(c)3 founded in 2019 in honor of our brave, lemon loving, butterfly catching, flower picking, warrior daughter Gianna Lilyfaith Cannelongo. She was adopted from China at 2 years old with a 1/2 of a heart but full of so much joy! On April 22, 2018, Gianna lost her earthly battle with cardiac heart disease and went home to be with Jesus at 6 years old. She won her eternal inheritance.  

  We miss and love her fiercely and grieve deeply till the day we will reunite on the shores of eternity. Her forever life continually reflects the light of Jesus and teaches us to live bold and brave for eternal treasures. 

  Therefore, through the GIA’S Hope Foundation, we desire to share this gift and hope with others.
ourVisionText: The vision of GIA'S Hope is a 4-part global initiative to plant God's seed of love. Our mission is to grow abundant life and bloom radiant hope through the four branches of our foundation for the most hurting and broken.
