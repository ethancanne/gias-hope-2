    description: We financially support vulnerable children’s ministries and provide adoption grants to families adopting children with special needs internationally.  Proverbs 31:8 says to “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.” So we are passionate about caring for and giving a voice to the most vulnerable, advocating for orphans in foster homes and orphanages, and especially for those with special needs. Every child deserves hope and the love of a forever family!
