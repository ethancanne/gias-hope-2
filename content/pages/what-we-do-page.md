    description: Our Foundation was first birthed with the desire to come alongside other families who are stepping out in faith to adopt! We were very blessed to receive many grants while we were adopting and we want to pass on the blessing so that many more orphans can come home to their forever families! We open our grant application link one or two times a year (depending on funding) to apply for a grant.

      After walking our baby girl to Jesus, we experienced the deepest grief of our lives, yet we also have experienced a tangible hope like never before that has rescued us from the pit of despair. It is our desire to share this radical hope of Jesus to the most broken and hurting in our community through various tools and resources that have helped us to fight forward in faith. It is our passion to walk close to those who are walking in a valley and to shine God's light in their darkness. 

      Some of our care ministries include home visits, letters and care packages sent to those who walk the road of grief, a mission's trip to Nicaragua to bring love to those who are broken and suffering, a newly launched local Farm Therapy ministry, and a Children's book that is in publication stage. We feel it's an honor to share Hope with others who need it because of the Hope Jesus gives us.
