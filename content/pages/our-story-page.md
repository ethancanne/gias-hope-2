  - title: Gianna’s Heart
    header: The Jar
    content: |-
      There's a mason jar sitting on our schoolroom shelf with about $12 in it. Just a month before Gianna went to heaven, she—along with Tahlia and Hudson—started a Farm Fresh egg business to raise money for babies in China who needed surgeries and families to adopt them. Every time they sold a dozen eggs, they would eagerly run to place the money in the jar and pray for the orphans in China, asking God that the money would one day help.

      Our tiny missionaries understood that God could use their big hearts to change the world. The jar still sits there, but that $12 has multiplied in countless, unimaginable ways, even in the depths of our wilderness. It was Gia's hand that was the last to place money in the jar, and both my heart aches and rejoices as I think of how many lives have been touched by Gianna's big heart and her legacy of light. I see that jar as a visual miracle, like the loaves and fish that continue to be poured out from her life, pointing others straight to the Gospel. God has multiplied that $12 with miracles of new life and hope that continue to grow in honor of our tiny missionary.

      We ache deeply to have her back in our arms and will grieve forever until that glorious day when we hold her again on the shores of eternity and all that is wrong will be made right again. Living with her absence on earth remains the worst pain imaginable. We lean every day into our God who promises eternal life from death, and we await, with hope, the day when He will make all things new!

    header: A Sacred Journey of Trust
    content: |-
      In 2014, God used our journey to Gianna and her life to push us off the comfortable shores of easy faith and into the deep waters of what it truly means to trust God, surrender all, and follow His heart straight into her broken heart. Her broken heart rescued us from a safe, comfortable faith. God gave us the grace to say a brave "YES" to her life, and we were able to see His glory through all our weaknesses.

      Even though our hearts are broken forever on this earth and we grieve beyond comprehension, we would not trade this overwhelming pain if it meant never knowing the overwhelming, radical joy of being hers forever. Loving will always be risky, but love always wins. Her life is a miracle and a testimony to the greatness of our God! What an honor it is to be her family forever, for all eternity!

    header: 'While We Wait: A Prayer for New Hope'
    content: |-
      While we wait on this broken earth, our prayer is that God would use our pain to birth new hope from her forever life! We ask God to bring new life from her life, new beauty from her beauty, and new light from all her light.

      Gianna’s life forever changed us from the first moment we saw her face. Her love wrecked our lives, and we are forever different. We choose, even in our grief, to let her life grow ours, teaching us to live bravely and invest our treasures in heaven, not on earth.

      Her life is forever remembered through the miracles that continue to bloom because of her radiant life! She is eternally carried, spoken about, and forever loved.

      For those new to our journey and not familiar with her story, we adopted Gianna in 2014 from Lily's House (formerly Harmony House) in China. Born with a major heart defect (she had only half a heart), Gianna's health was fragile. It was truly a love explosion at first sight, but not without fear for the unpredictable and unknown road ahead. However, I am so thankful fear did not win…oh, how we would have missed so much goodness and beauty by staying safe!

      From the moment we embraced her, our hearts fiercely wrapped around her broken heart, and we knew we had been changed forever simply by holding such a precious miracle. We jumped off a cliff, trusting completely, knowing this holy collision of our lives would forever change our trajectory. We knew this moment was sacred and would be marked on our hearts eternally, and there was no going back. We would be different forever—never the same again—never satisfied with life on the shore, but out in the deep, seeing God bigger than we ever had. Her life wrecked us in all the right and radical ways. Oh, what a beautiful gift she is!

      In honor of Gianna’s life, we have created Live Gia Grow Forever Foundation (now known as Gia’s Hope). This foundation is birthed from her heartbeat and carries on her legacy of hope for orphans and families. Support for Lily’s House: We help fund Lily’s House, the foster home that cared for Gianna, in honor of her life. Adoption Grants: We provide financial support to families working to bring children home. Every adoption story is a story of redemption, faith, and hope. We are honored to come alongside these families.

      Gianna wanted to see orphans find families, and we desire to carry out that mission. Through this foundation, we have 4 primary purposes:

      1. **Orphan Care:** To provide financial support for orphanages and foster homes caring for orphans
      2. **Orphan Prevention:** To provide financial support for families in crisis to prevent orphans from being abandoned.
      3. **Adoption Aid:** To provide financial support for families adopting children.
      4. **Care Ministry:** Home visits, letters and care packages sent to those who walk the road of grief, loss, and adoption.

      We also hope to continue expanding our vision as God leads us, bringing even more hope to families and orphans in honor of Gianna’s life.
